# narrow_band_least_squares
Uses the open source [uafgeotools/lts_array](https://github.com/uafgeotools/lts_array) in multiple sequential narrow frequency bands.

## Dependencies
- [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/)
- Required: [uafgeotools/lts_array](https://github.com/uafgeotools/lts_array)
- Optional: [uafgeotools/waveform_collection](https://github.com/uafgeotools/waveform_collection) if you would like to gather waveforms with that repository. 
- These two repositories are included here as [git submodules](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/git-submodule), so a copy of them are installed in this repository.

## Installation
In Terminal, navigate to the directory you wish to install then download the repository by running the following:
```
>> git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/amiezzi/narrow_band_least_squares.git
```
This will create a folder named `narrow_band_least_squares`. 

```
>> cd narrow_band_least_squares
>> conda env create -f environment.yml
```
This will create a conda environment named `nbls`. 

## Usage
To use the code, you will need to activate the conda environment by 
```
>> conda activate nbls
```

Run an example script in the `narrow_band_least_squares` directory by 
```
>> python example.py
```
